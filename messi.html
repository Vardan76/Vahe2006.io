    <b><mark>Lionel Andrés Messi</mark></b>
    <i>(Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] <a style="color: blue;" href="#m1"> born 24 June 1987</a>)</i>,
    also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays
    as a forward for <b>Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the
      Argentina national team</b>. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
    all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a
    record six <b>European Golden Shoes</b>, and in 2020 was named to the <b>Ballon d'Or
      Dream Team</b>. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire
    professional career with <b>Barcelona</b>, where he won a <i>club-record 35
      trophies, including 10 <b>La Liga</b> titles, seven <b>Copa del Rey</b> titles and four
      <b>UEFA Champions Leagues</b></i>. With his country, he won the 2021 <b>Copa América</b> and
    the 2022 <b>FIFA World Cup</b>. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker,
    Messi holds the records for <b>most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks
      in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La
      Liga (192) and the Copa América (17)</b>. He has also the most international
    goals by a South American male (98). Messi has scored over <b>790</b> senior
    career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for
    a single club (672).
  </p>

  <p>
    Born and raised in central <i>Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the age
      of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in
      October 2004</i>. He established himself as an integral player for the club
    within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in
    2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football;
    that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful
    seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making
    him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12
    season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a
    single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top
    scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon
    d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before
    regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time
    top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble,
    after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed
    captaincy of <b>Barcelona</b> in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon
    d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for <b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> in August 2021.

    Early life
  </h2>

  <p>
    Messi was born <i>on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe</i>, the third of four
    children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia
    Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's
    side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of
    immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on
    his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[6] Growing up in a
    tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the
    sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers,
    Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi,
    both of whom became professional footballers.[12] At the age of four he
    joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his
    earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia,
    who accompanied him to training and matches.[13] He was greatly affected
    by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a
    devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and
    pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.
