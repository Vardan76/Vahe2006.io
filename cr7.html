    <b><mark> Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</mark></b> GOIH ComM
    <i>(Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu];
      <a style="color: blue;" href="#r1">born 5 February 1985)</a></i>
    is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and
    captains both
    <b>Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national
      team</b>. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has
    won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the
    most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including
    seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European
    Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for
    most
    <b>appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions
      League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals
      (118), and joint-most international appearances (196)</b>. He is one of the few players to have made over
    <b>1,100</b> professional career appearances, and has scored over
    <b>800</b> official senior career goals for club and country.
  </p>




  <p>
    Ronaldo began his senior career with <b>Sporting CP</b>, before signing
    with <b>Manchester United</b> in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first
    season. He would also go on to win three consecutive
    <b>Premier League</b> titles, the <b>Champions League</b> and the
    <b>FIFA Club World Cup</b>; at age 23, he won his first
    <b>Ballon d'Or</b>. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive
    association football transfer when he signed for <b>Real Madrid</b> in
    2009 in a transfer worth <b><i>€94 million (£80 million)</i></b>. He became a key contributor and formed an
    attacking trio with
    <i>Karim Benzema</i> and <i>Gareth Bale</i> which was integral to the team
    winning four <b>Champions League</b> wins from 2014 to 2018, including La
    Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back <b>Ballons d'Or</b> in
    2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times
    behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's
    all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions
    League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive
    seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won two
    <b>La Liga</b>titles, two <b>Copa del Rey</b>, four
    <b>Champions Leagues</b>, three
    <b>UEFA Super Cup and three Club World Cups</b>. In 2018, he signed for
    Juventus in a transfer worth an initial
    <b><i>€100 million (£88 million)</i></b>, the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over
    30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies
    and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural
    <u>Serie A Most Valuable Player</u>
    and the
    <u>first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and
      Italian leagues, before returning to Manchester United in 2021</u>. He left in 2022, after his contract with the
    club was terminated. In
    2023, Ronaldo signed for Al Nassr.

   >What is Cristiano Ronaldo's net worth?</h2>
  <img style="float:left; margin: 25px; width: 20%;" src="images/cr7/c12.jpg">
  <p>Ronaldo is reported to have a net worth of around $500 million (£363m), but no one can really claim to have a
    bulletproof idea of what Ronaldo is worth except his management company.

    The estimated net worth of Ronaldo is slightly higher than that of his long-time rival Lionel Messi, though the
    Argentine has won more lucrative contracts in recent years. The lucrative move to Saudi Arabia should go some way
    towards ensuring Ronaldo remains out in front.

    Ronaldo was ranked third on Forbes' 2022 list of the highest paid athletes in the world, with earnings of $115
    million (£93m), which was a reduction in $5m on the previous year.

    On that occasion, the Portugal captain was behind Messi, who topped the list, and NBA icon LeBron James, who was
    second. He was ahead of Neymar, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Roger Federer among others. Ronaldo's most significant
    sponsorship deal is with Nike, which was renewed around the same time he extended his last Madrid contract.

    The agreement with Nike is said to be the second lifetime contract the sportswear giant has handed out after it
    offered similar terms to three-time NBA champion LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers icon's deal has been
    speculated to be worth in excess of $1 billion in total, though exactly how that breaks down year-by-year is kept
    under wraps.

    Naturally, many have assumed that Ronaldo has signed on a comparable basis. Though the $1bn figure seems
    extraordinary, it is worth noting that sponsorship analysts Hookit estimated that Ronaldo's social-media presence
    alone was worth an incredible $474m to Nike in 2016.

    Beyond Nike, Ronaldo has had endorsement deals with the likes of Armani, Tag Heuer, Egyptian Steel, Herbalife,
    Italia Independent, Clear, PokerStars and Castrol.

  <p>
    Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born
    <i>on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of
      the Portuguese island of Madeira</i>, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is the
    fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro,
    a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit
    man.[10] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade,
    was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older
    brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12]
    His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his
    father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor
    refused to perform the procedure.[13][14] Ronaldo grew up in an
    impoverished Catholic Christian home, sharing a room with all his
    siblings.[15] As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to
    1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[10] and later spent two years
    with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with
    Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved
    from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth
    academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play
    semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to
    focus entirely on football.[18] With a troubled life as a student[19] and
    living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he didn't complete
    schooling beyond the 6th grade.[20][21] While popular with other students
    at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who
    he said had "disrespected" him.[18] One year later, he was diagnosed with
    tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing
    football.[22] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to
    cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart
    rate.[23] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure
    and resumed training a few days later.[24]
