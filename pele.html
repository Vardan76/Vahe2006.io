    <p><b><mark> Arantes do Nascimento</b></mark> <i>(Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛdsõ(w) aˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nasiˈmẽtu]; <a
          style="color: blue;" href="#p1"> born 23
          October 1940 – 29 December 2022</a>)</i>, better known by his nickname <b><mark>Pele</mark></b> (Portuguese
      pronunciation: [peˈlɛ]), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. Regarded as one of the
      greatest players of all time and labelled "the greatest" by <b><abbr style="text-decoration:none;"
          title="Fédération Internationale de Football Association">FIFA</abbr></b>, he was among the most
      successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999, he was named <q><b>Athlete of the Century by
          the International Olympic Committee</b></q> and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important
      people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted <q><b>World Player of the Century by the International
          Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS)</b></q> and was one of the two joint winners of the
      FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a
      <q><b>World Record</b></q>.
    </p>

    <p>Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he
      won three <b>FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970</b>, the only player to do so. He was nicknamed <q><b>O
          Rei</b></q> (The King) following the 1958 tournament. Pelé is the joint-top goalscorer for Brazil with
      <b>goals in 92 games</b>. At the club level, he was Santos's all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659
      games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and
      1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase "The Beautiful Game" with football, Pelé's
      "electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals" made him a star around the world, and his teams toured
      internationally to take full advantage of his popularity.[5] During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the
      best-paid athlete in the world. After retiring in 1977, Pelé was a worldwide ambassador for football and made
      many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.

      Averaging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pelé was adept at striking the ball with either foot in
      addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also
      drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would
      also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he was hailed as a national hero for his
      accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the
      poor. His emergence at the 1958 <b>World Cup</b>, where he became a black global sporting star, was a source of
      inspiration.[6] Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received numerous individual and team awards
      for his performance on the field, his record-breaking achievements, and his legacy in the sport.

    <h2 id="p1" class="HeadsP">Early life</h1>
      <p>Pelé was born <b>Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 in Três Corações</b>, Minas Gerais, the son
        of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of
        two siblings,[7] with brother Zoca also playing for Santos, albeit not as successfully.[8] He was named
        after the American inventor Thomas Edison.[9] His parents decided to remove the "i" and call him "Edson",
        but there was a typo on his birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as "Edison", not
        "Edson", as he was called.[9][10] He was originally nicknamed "Dico" by his family.[7][11] He received the
        nickname <b>"Pelé"</b> during his school days, when, it is claimed, he was given it because of his
        pronunciation of the name of his favourite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke,
        but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated he had no idea what the name
        means, nor did his old friends.[7] Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of "Bilé",
        the word has no meaning in Portuguese.[note 2]

        Pelé grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of São Paulo. He earned extra money by working in tea shops as
        a servant. Taught to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with
        either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with string or a grapefruit.[13][7] He played for several
        amateur teams in his youth, including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Ameriquinha.[14]
        Pelé led Bauru Atlético Clube juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to two São Paulo state youth
        championships.[15] In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football
        had just become popular in Bauru when Pelé began playing it. He was part of the first futsal (indoor
        football) competition in the region. Pelé and his team won the first championship and several others.
        According to Pelé, futsal (indoor football) presented difficult challenges: he said it was a lot quicker
        than football on the grass, and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each
        other in the pitch. Pelé credits futsal for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, futsal
        allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old. In one of the tournaments he participated
        in, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with 14 or 15
        goals. "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come"
