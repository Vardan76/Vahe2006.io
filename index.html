	<p><b><mark>Football</mark></b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, <b><i>kicking a ball to
				score a goal</i></b>. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the
		most popular
		where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in
		North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian
		football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various
		forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as <b>"football codes".</b></p>

	<p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
		parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
		games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the
		British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
		controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
		Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in
		order to maintain their heritage.[8] <b>In 1888</b>, The Football League was founded in <b>England</b>, becoming
		the first
		of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
		football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>

		HISTORY
	</h2>
	<p>There can be no end to debate among football fans over who is the best footballer in the world. There is no
		end to the love for football. If you are a football fan, you must know about the free football streaming
		sites on pathofex.</p>

	<p>Every soccer fan has their own list, and the hot topic among them always remains <b>who is best?</b> <mark>Messi
			or
			Cristiano Ronaldo?</mark> To end all the debates and fan fights, here’s our list based on stats and
		performances.
	</p>

	<p> To fully appreciate Ronaldo's greatness, you need to zoom out and not let his shambolic 2022 antics cloud
		your judgement of him. In time<sup>2022</sup>, once his career is all said and done, Cristiano will have
		more than earned his seat at the top table of all-time greats.

		I know I said stats aren't everything, and trophies aren't everything, but when they are largely the result
		of one man, the most ferocious competitor in the history of football, they become incredibly difficult to
		ignore.

		<b><mark>Ronaldo</mark></b> has lit up the <b>Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, claiming each nation's
			domestic title and cup
			trophy. He boasts five Champions League titles across two teams and lifted the European Championship trophy
			with Portugal</b>.

		In each of those seasons, in every triumph, Ronaldo will have produced a clutch moment of brilliance. Last
		minute penalties? No problem. Thunderous strikes against the run of play? Sorted. Fire-and-brimstone
		performances that could turn the tide against the odds? Done.

		Ronaldo's career has been a masterclass in winning. His never-say-die attitude and matchday mentality at his
		prime was unrivalled. The 37-year-old's inability to age gracefully should not detract from two decades of
		mounting evidence to suggest he will go down as <b>"the greatest European footballer of all time"</b>.
	</p>

	<p>There's not a lot to be said that hasn't already been said about <mark>Leo Messi</mark>, but I'm going to try.

		We'll get the stats out of the way first. Messi has bagged <b>791 goals and 350 assists in 1,002 games for club
			and country</b>. That works out at 72 minutes per goal contribution. Every 72 minutes. Across an 18-year
		career.

		Many elite players are figured out, they're sussed, they enjoy a few seasons in the sun before someone
		cracks the code and neutralises them. Not Messi; never Messi.

		Messi has adapted throughout his career, mainly to accommodate his gentle deceleration, but the end product
		has always remained the same.

		His touch is extraordinary, applying the correct weight to every delicate tap like a fine artist working on
		their masterpiece. The ball sticks to his feet, under his spell, and his measured passing ability is simply
		the greatest of all time. <b><i>Nobody has or will ever split a defence quite like Lionel Messi</i></b>.

		When he doesn't feel like passing through you, the Argentine megastar will simply turn the world's greatest
		defenders inside out. He has pulled many of them around like rag dolls in front of their families. He leaves
		few prisoners.

		And at the end of those runs, he has shown great selflessness in the past to cut the ball back with
		pin-sharp accuracy or he'll slide, dink or flick the ball over the keeper. In every great chance he creates,
		Messi effectively gives himself a multiple-choice question about how he'd like to score in that given
		moment. It's not about whether he'll find the net, it's about how.</p>

	<p>The media have often drawn comparisons between <mark>Neymar <sub> da Silva JR</sub></mark> and Brazilian legend
		<b>Pelé</b>,
		as Neymar possesses similar attributes and also like Pelé came from the Santos Youth Academy and turned
		heads with his skill. Neymar has said that Pelé is his "role model" but also saying: <i>"I don't like to make a
			comparison with Pelé"</i>.[313] He has also been compared to compatriot <b>Ronaldinho</b>.

		Neymar's increasing reputation led both the media and former great players to draw comparisons between
		Neymar and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, which Neymar has commented on saying: "Messi is above everyone,
		there is no use comparing me with him. He is the best player in the world and I always get inspired when I
		watch good football."<b>Ronaldo</b> stated: "Neymar is a great talent, the best we have in Brazil. He is very
		similar to Messi." <b>Zico</b> said: <i>"I see Neymar like a Cristiano Ronaldo or a Messi, the type who appears
			and
			makes things happen."</i> After his hat-trick in a 3–1 victory against Internacional in the Copa
		Libertadores and Messi's five goals scored in the Champions League, Neymar said: "I am a Messi fan. I was
		told what he did today. I support him to score a lot of nice goals so I can keep copying and imitating him.
	</p>

	<p>All of Brazilian football is geared towards embodying the spirit of <b><mark>Pele</mark></b>. Anything you've
		ever seen a
		Brazilian footballer do well, it is because Pele has done it before them. He is arguably the greatest ever
		player on the international stage with <b>77 goals for Brazil in just 92 games with three World Cups</b> to his
		name.

		Pele's legacy is an interesting one. There are those who scrunch up their faces at Pele's records, most
		particularly his claimed <b>1,281 goals in 1,363 games line</b>, when in fact a tranche of those games were
		exhibition showpieces against far weaker opposition. However, his record excluding those games remains
		immense. He notched a reported <b>643 goals for Santos in 659 games across</b> an 18-year spell before taking
		his
		talents to the US with New York Cosmos to wrap up his career.

		Many use the fact he never played regularly in Europe as a stick to beat Pele with, but his international
		record speaks volumes about his talent in any context. His devastating pace and deadly accurate finishing
		were simply too much for some of the world's greatest defences at the time, and would likely be too much for
		them today at his prime.</p>
