  <p><b><mark>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior</mark></b> <i>(<a style="color: blue;" href=#n1>born 5 February
        1992</a>)</i>, known as Neymar, is a <b>Brazilian
      professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national
      team</b>. A prolific goalscorer and renowned playmaker, he is regarded as one of the best players in the world, as
    well as one of the greatest Brazilian footballers of all time. Neymar has scored at least <b>100</b> goals for
    three different clubs, making him one of three players to achieve this.</p>


  <p>Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two
    successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being
    Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012,
    and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis
    Suárez, dubbed <b>MSN</b>, he won the continental treble of <b>La Liga</b>, the <b>Copa del Rey</b>, and the <b>UEFA
      Champions League</b>.
    He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. Motivated to be a talisman at club level, Neymar
    transferred to <b>PSG</b> in 2017[7] in a move worth <i><b>€222 million</b></i>, making him the most expensive
    player ever.[note 1]
    In France, he won four league titles, among other honours, and was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut
    season.[10] Notably, he helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its
    first ever Champions League Final.</p>

  <h2 id="n1" class="HeadsN">Early life</h2>
  <p><mark>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior</mark> was born in <i>Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo</i>, to Neymar Santos Sr. and
    Nadine da Silva
    and had a Christian upbringing.[14][15] He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and
    became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[16] Neymar comments on his father's role: <i>"My father
      has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family."</i> Growing up,
    Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[18] Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on
    him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight
    spaces.[19]</p>

  <p> 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa
    Santista.[20] Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos.[21] With the success of his
    youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos'
    home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning <i>10,000 reais</i> per month
    and
    at 16, <i>125,000 reais</i> per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the
    Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals</p>
